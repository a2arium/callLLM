# MCP SDK Integration Phase 6: Error Handling & Retry

## Overview

Phase 6 focused on implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms for the MCP SDK integration. The goal was to ensure that transient errors are handled gracefully with retries, while permanent errors are properly categorized and reported to the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Error Types

- Created `MCPAuthenticationError` for auth-related failures
- Created `MCPTimeoutError` for timeout-specific errors
- Enhanced existing error types with `cause` property to preserve error context

### 2. Integrated RetryManager

- Added `RetryManager` to the `MCPServiceAdapter` class
- Implemented smart retry logic based on error types
- Configured default retry settings (max 3 retries, exponential backoff)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added error mapping from SDK-specific errors to callLLM error types
- Implemented specialized error detection for network issues, timeouts, etc.
- Added proper logging for different error scenarios

### 4. Added Retry Logic

- Implemented retry logic in `executeTool` and `getServerTools` methods
- Added distinction between retryable and non-retryable errors
- Ensured streaming operations are not retried (as they return iterators)

### 5. Added Unit Tests

- Created comprehensive test cases for error handling and retry functionality
- Added tests for error mapping (network, auth, timeout errors)
- Added tests for retry behavior with transient vs. permanent errors

## Technical Details

### Error Classification

Errors are now classified into several categories:

1. **Authentication Errors**: Require user intervention (no retry)
2. **Timeout Errors**: Likely transient (retryable)
3. **Network Errors**: Connection issues (retryable)
4. **Tool-Not-Found Errors**: Permanent errors (not retryable)
5. **Invalid Parameter Errors**: Permanent errors (not retryable)

### Retry Strategy

The retry strategy includes:

- **Exponential backoff**: Starting with 500ms and increasing exponentially
- **Maximum retries**: 3 attempts by default
- **Selective retry**: Only retrying for transient errors
- **Bypass option**: Optional parameter to disable retries when needed

### Testing Approach

Tests focused on verifying:

1. Correct error mapping for different error types
2. Proper retry behavior for transient errors
3. No retry for permanent errors
4. Error context preservation throughout the retry process

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent overwhelming failing servers
2. Add more granular retry control (per-server or per-tool configuration)
3. Implement rate limiting detection and adaptive retries
4. Add telemetry and metrics for error rates and retry attempts

## Definition of Done Verification

All tasks in the Phase 6 definition of done have been completed:

- ✅ SDK errors are caught and translated into meaningful errors for `callLLM`
- ✅ Retry logic is implemented for key SDK calls
- ✅ Connection failures, timeouts, and tool call errors are handled robustly
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage for error handling and retry mechanisms

# MCP SDK Migration - Phase 1 Summary

## Goal of Phase 1
Replace the custom transport factory with SDK transport instantiation within the MCPServiceAdapter and implement the connection logic, including the Streamable HTTP -> SSE fallback strategy.

## Accomplishments

1. **Transport Instantiation**
   - Created a new `MCPServiceAdapter` class that serves as an adapter layer between callLLM's interfaces and the MCP SDK.
   - Implemented the `createTransport` method to create SDK `Transport` instances based on `MCPServerConfig`.
   - Added support for the three transport types:
     - `StdioClientTransport` for stdio servers
     - `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` for HTTP servers with 'streamable' mode (or default)
     - `SSEClientTransport` for HTTP servers with 'sse' mode

2. **Connection Logic**
   - Implemented `connectToServer` method to establish connections to MCP servers
   - Added proper error handling and resource cleanup
   - Created connection and disconnection methods with appropriate logging
   - Implemented server management (connection tracking, status checking)

3. **HTTP Fallback Strategy**
   - Implemented Streamable HTTP -> SSE fallback logic in the `connectWithHttp` method
   - The system first tries to connect using `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`
   - If the connection fails with a protocol-related error (like HTTP 404/405), it falls back to `SSEClientTransport`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with servers that only support SSE

4. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for the `MCPServiceAdapter` class
   - Tested different transport types, connection scenarios, and the fallback strategy
   - Achieved good test coverage for the implemented functionality

5. **Example**
   - Created an example file in `examples/mcp-sdk-adapter.ts` that demonstrates how to use the `MCPServiceAdapter`

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Adapter Pattern**: We created a dedicated adapter class that encapsulates the SDK interactions rather than directly replacing the existing implementation. This allows for:
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
   - Better testability
   - Gradual migration in subsequent phases
   - Maintaining the existing configuration format

2. **Transport Inference**: The adapter can infer the appropriate transport type from the configuration if not explicitly specified, making it more user-friendly.

3. **Client/Transport Management**: The adapter manages `Client` and `Transport` instances internally, maintaining their lifecycle and state.

4. **Error Handling**: Implemented consistent error handling patterns that preserve the existing error types and information flow.

## Next Steps - Phase 2: Tool Loading & Definition

1. **Update MCPToolLoader**
   - Refactor `MCPToolLoader` to use the new `MCPServiceAdapter` instead of `MCPClientManager`
   - Implement logic to convert SDK tool definitions to callLLM's `ToolDefinition` format
   - Update tool naming conventions to maintain backward compatibility

2. **Tool Definition Adaptation**
   - Create conversion utility to map between SDK tool schemas and callLLM's tool schemas
   - Ensure parameter validation is preserved
   - Maintain the naming convention for tools (serverKey_toolName)

3. **Tool Function Generation**
   - Update the `callFunction` generation logic to use the SDK client's `callTool` method
   - Ensure proper streaming support
   - Handle parameter validation and error handling

4. **Update Integration Tests**
   - Create/update integration tests to verify full tool loading and execution flow
   - Test with both streaming and non-streaming scenarios

5. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new implementation
   - Add migration notes for users with custom MCP integrations

## Potential Challenges for Phase 2

1. **Schema Differences**: The SDK might represent tool schemas differently from the current implementation
2. **Streaming Integration**: Ensuring streaming works properly across the adapter boundary
3. **Tool Call Context**: Maintaining the necessary context for tool calls (e.g., history management)
4. **Error Handling**: Adapting SDK error types to maintain compatibility with existing error handling

## Definition of Done for Phase 2

1. `MCPToolLoader` successfully uses `MCPServiceAdapter` to fetch and convert tools
2. Tools can be properly loaded, registered, and executed through the new adapter
3. Streaming tool calls work correctly
4. Integration tests verify the end-to-end flow
5. Documentation updated to reflect changes

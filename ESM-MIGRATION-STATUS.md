## Migration Progress

### Phase 1: Preparation & Audit ✅
- ✅ Created feature/esm-migration branch
- ✅ Verified Node ≥ 18 in CI & local
- ✅ Listed dependencies and their ESM status
- ✅ Analyzed critical compatibility issues

### Phase 2: Core Config Flip ✅
- ✅ Added "type": "module" to package.json
- ✅ Updated tsconfig.json with "module": "nodenext", "moduleResolution": "nodenext"
- ✅ Set up dual output with CJS fallback entry

### Phase 3: Bulk Code Rewrite ✅
- ✅ No `require`/`module.exports` found in production code
- ✅ Fixed `__dirname` usage with ESM pattern
- ✅ Added .js extensions to all internal imports
- ✅ Created automatic fixes via script (scripts/fix-all-imports.mjs)
- ✅ Verified compilation and ESM imports work

### Phase 4: Publishing & Package Structure (Planned)
- ⬜ Verify paths and exports configuration
- ⬜ Implement subpath exports
- ⬜ Update README with ESM usage examples
- ⬜ Prepare for release

### Phase 5: Test Suite & CI Migration (Planned)
- ⬜ Update Jest config for ESM
- ⬜ Fix test suite imports
- ⬜ Fix test libraries and mocks for ESM
- ⬜ Update CI workflows

### Dependencies ESM Compatibility

Good news! All core dependencies in the project support ES Modules:

- **openai** package provides dual module support via its exports field with ESM as the default format
- **sharp** library supports ESM imports despite having "type": "commonjs" in its package.json
- All other dependencies provide dual module support or native ESM

This means we can import all dependencies directly using standard ESM syntax without needing dynamic imports:

## Notes

The migration has successfully completed through Phase 3. Key accomplishments:

1. All source code now uses ESM import/export syntax
2. Internal relative imports include `.js` file extensions
3. `__dirname` references replaced with ESM-compatible pattern
4. Both ESM and CommonJS builds are generated
5. Dual package support configured via `exports` field in package.json

Remaining tasks focus on finalizing the package structure for publishing and updating the test suite.
